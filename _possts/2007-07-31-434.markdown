i was reading on wikipedia and a link brought me to this article

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer%27s_Phobia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer%27s_Phobi</a>

I watched this episode and i remembered it, but i don’t konw it was an outstanding one (theme-wise and award-wise) and story hehind it (Fox tried to censor it).

Who would thought gay theme topic would be taboo in the US in <strong>1997</strong>. I think it’s still a very conservative enviornment in “over the air”
