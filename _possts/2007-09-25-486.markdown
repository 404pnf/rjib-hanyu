re: How not to give a sympathetic quote

It’s only a matter of time. And I predict:



1) All the planes will be black



2) They’ll all have those “whonk whonk!” official sounding horns



3) There will be a lively black market in military and official hull registration numbers.



4) If you think it sucks to have private planes preempting commercial traffic in the US, wait until the same dynamic starts to infest China’s overmatched civil aviation infrastructure. Having watched the second ring get closed for a motorcade in Beijing yesterday yet again…
