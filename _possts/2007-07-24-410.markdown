After seeing the crowds on the final ascent cables and the tourists wearing Teva sandals for a 17-mile hike, I thought to myself, gee, this reminds me of some places I’ve been before. It looks like a scene out of any hiking trail in China, where you’ve got Chinese women wearing skirts and high heels climbing up precipitous trails, and men wearing leather soled dress shoes and their Sunday best clothes trying to do the same. This is the typical scene at mountains like Huang Shan, Tai Shan, and Hua Shan in China. I’ve been to all of those, and unfortunately there’s not much opportunity to really get in touch with nature like you can in our national parks in America.
