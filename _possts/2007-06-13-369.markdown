upon read <a href="http://www.rssowl.org/node/216">this</a>, i wrote a email to lvcha to rec’d him take a look at rssowl.

i don’t know why i post it here. practice english? welcome you guys to anatomize my words?! haha, welcome~

define:

anatomy

anatomize

–

rssowl is written in java, it’s an

rss reader

i used it a few years back, had some

email exchange with the author

then i use thunderbird exclusively

becase i love the way it treats rss

msg as email

Cons

rssowl is not for me because, 1,

it’s very hard to increase text font

2 it can not archive all articles,

older ones got deleted, i talked

with the author about this he said

he would implement 3 on windows

platform it uses IE to render feed

message, though later it could use

geck-engine which is used by mozilla

andfirefox

i don’t want to or need to check it

out but you might be intersted

Pros

a great feature of it is it can

export multiple articles as pdf

and/or html, really handy when you

want to read something on your pda,

i used to do that a lot  <img src='http://www.rijiben.org/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

i noticed a lot of effort has been put into the search functionality, so, it might be strong in that area.
