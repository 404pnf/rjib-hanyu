这个一定是 六指琴魔 了。哈哈。他弹的是什么琴啊。

刚看到其实第一批武侠电影在30年代就很流行了，而且是最流行。后来国民党政府和当时文化界精英觉得这些内容宣传迷信和无政府注意。

<blockquote>

The boom came to an end in the 1930s, caused by official opposition from cultural and political elites, especially the Kuomintang government, who saw it as promoting superstition and violent anarchy.[2]

<li>The lute is a plucked string instrument with a fretted neck and a deep round back. It evolved from an instrument originally developed in the Middle East, which was also the ancestor of the superficially similar oud. The words ‘lute’ and ‘oud’ are both derived from Arabic al‘ud, “the wood”. The player of a lute is called a lutenist, and a maker of lutes (or guitars) is called a luthier.
