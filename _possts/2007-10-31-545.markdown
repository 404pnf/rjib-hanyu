<blockquote>

LOL, hilarious (it’s only funny cuz ur not hurt)



I’ve learned my lesson not to make eye contact much less talk to a stranger. Nothing good ever comes out of it. They’re either crazy or want to con you (even hurt you).



I was conned in Paris out of all places. Paris is FULL of parasites - be aware…
