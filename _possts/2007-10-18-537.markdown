Just last night, the Supreme Court stayed the execution of Carlton Turner Jr., a Texas death row inmate. The Court did not give a reason for the stay: Turner requested it until the constitutionality of the method can be decided by the Justices.



In a separate development yesterday, Alabama Gov. Bob Riley stayed the execution of Tommy Arthur, who won’t be executed until the state can be sure that its lethal injection protocol will ensure that the inmate is unconscious before the fatal dose is delivered.

stay这种当动词的用法值得记忆。
