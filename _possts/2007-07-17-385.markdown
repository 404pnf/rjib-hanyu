正好今天看了一篇关于那个“曾经叫prince的艺人”的文章。：）

去wikipedia看他的介绍。非常喜欢。

<blockquote>

In 1995, during negotiations regarding the release of Prince’s album The Gold Experience, a battle between Warner Bros. and Prince ensued, struggling over the artistic and financial control of Prince’s output. During that time, Prince only appeared in public with the word “SLAVE” written on his cheek. Prince explained his name change as follows:



<blockquote>

The first step I have taken towards the ultimate goal of emancipation from the chains that bind me to Warner Bros. was to change my name from Prince to Image:prince symbol.svg. Prince is the name that my Mother gave me at birth. Warner Bros. took the name, trademarked it, and used it as the main marketing tool to promote all of the music that I wrote. The company owns the name Prince and all related music marketed under Prince. I became merely a pawn used to produce more money for Warner Bros.… I was born Prince and did not want to adopt another conventional name. The only acceptable replacement for my name, and my identity, was Image:prince symbol.svg, a symbol with no pronunciation, that is a representation of me and what my music is about. This symbol is present in my work over the years; it is a concept that has evolved from my frustration; it is who I am. It is my name.

我买的第一盘“正版磁带”就有prince的精选，同时买的另一盘是sting的fields of gold那盘。开始听prince不是特别习惯，但越来越觉得他确实是奇才。

很有意思看到1999这首歌可能有关于核武器扩散的内容。看了下歌词，还真可以这么理解：）但wikipedia上的文章没有直接说。<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_%28song%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_%28song%29</a>
