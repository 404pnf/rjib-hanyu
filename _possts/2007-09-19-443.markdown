Does this mean when user register their accounts, they agree to the agreement that they never read to put their comments under CC?If this is valid. That’s good, maybe i shoud begin translate some comments. If this is valid, it’s bad, too. Because other websites may claim sole ownership of user submitted comments because they agreed to the agreement of registration.
