<blockquote>

The deterioration of translation quality is related to the dire situation of the industry for translated works.



Over the past twenty years, the salaries for most professions have increased by twenty fold.  But the salary for translators has only doubled.  In the early 1980’s, the basic fee for translation was 30 yuan per 1,000 words.  At the moment, the basic fee for translation is only 60 yuan per 1,000 words.

这样看来，与其挣翻译费。不如免费翻译或者通过翻译作为手段用其他方式挣钱。

<blockquote>

The problem is that translation is also the kind of work that has a high requirement on the quality of the worker.  A person who graduated from a university foreign language department (or even someone who has studied overseas) can become a simultaneous interpreter at a large conference, but this person may not be able to handle the job of translating a work of literature.  Translation requires that a person must know the foreign language, have good Chinese-language skills as well as have a deep understanding and grasp of the culture and history of the foreign country.

最后总结：

<blockquote>

This is the true crisis that the Chinese cultural industry must face up to.  Over the past century, there were two popular waves of translation on mainland China.  The first time was in the 1930’s.  Through the efforts of translation masters such as Yan Fu, Liang Qichao, Lu Xun and others, works such as the social evolutionary theory of Herbert Spencer, <Capital> of Karl Marx, the Cosmos of Wilhelm von Humboldt and the philosophy of Bertrand Russell were introduced to the troubled China.  The second wave occurred in the 1980’s, when <Les Miserables>, <War and Peace> and other famous works were no longer banned, and they gave a breath of freshness to the Chinese people coming out of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into these formerly banned worlds.  Today, the world economy is converging into one body even though regional cultural clashes are also becoming fiercer.  But the situation with translation in China today may lead the Chinese to fall into a new and voluntary self-imposed blockade from the outside world.
