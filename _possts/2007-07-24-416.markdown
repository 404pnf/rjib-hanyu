SAR stands for Special Administration Region. So HKSAR stands for Hong Kong SAR.

<blockquote>

The Government has commenced preparatory work to receive the giant pandas.  Following the arrangements in 1999 when An An and Jia Jia were given to Hong Kong, the Government will entrust the care of the new giant pandas to the Ocean Park.
