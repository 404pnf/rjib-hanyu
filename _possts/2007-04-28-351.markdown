‘nee’:<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Anee">http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Anee</a> 这个词怎么用啊。我看到他的上下文和女性婚前名根本没有关系。中文是什么。

bq. (meaning literally `born’) used to indicate the maiden or family name of a married woman; “Hillary Clinton nee Rodham”

bq. The French word née (feminine) or né (masculine) (or the English word nee) is still commonly used in some newspapers when mentioning the maiden name of a woman in engagement or wedding announcements. The word nee is also used to denote former names, (as opposed to birth names), and earlier names of inanimate entities such as companies and products. Né is the past participle of naître (to be born) and means born in the French language.

我gogole一下nee希望能看到用法结果都是一些韩国一位叫nee的女明星自杀的消息和她的照片之类。

请大家帮忙。
