trail brief

<blockquote>

A trial brief is where a party tells the court what claims it will be present at trial. It gives the judge an overview of the case. You could think of it as a kind of written, pre-trial opening statement, but to the judge. You’ve maybe seen opening statements to a jury on TV, where the lawyer tells the jury what happened and what it intends to prove, and this is similar but because it’s for the judge, it’s less dramatic. No pounding on the table.

ow i know why this term jumped into my head, Chris Rock starred in a movie called Down to Earth. It’s good comedy. 有一段他在多呐店里听见外面dmx的歌曲跟着唱起来特别有意思。哈哈，我印象非常深刻。之后又特别找了更多的dmx来听。从此非常喜欢dmx。
