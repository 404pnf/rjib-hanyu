it takes two to tango 的意思是 一个巴掌拍不想

听 louis armstrong 的老歌，有一首叫 it takes two to tango。

这首歌里，他是指这个词的字面意思

bq. Hey baby, how about this dance?

Why? ’cause it takes two to do this dance!

<pre><code>Takes two to tango, two to tango,

two to really get the feeling of romance.

Lets do the tango, do the tango,

do the dance of love.

You can sail on a ship by yourself,

take a nap or a nip by yourself.

You can get into debt on your own,

ther's a lot of things that you can do alone!

But ...

Takes two to tango, two to tango,

two to really get the feeling of romance.

Lets do the tango, do the tango,

do the dance of love.

You can stare at the moon by yourself,

take a laugh like a loon by yourself,

spend a lot, go to pot on your own,

there's a lot of things that you can do alone!

But listen here...

Takes two to tango, two to tango,

two to really get the feeling of romance.

Lets do the tango, do the tango,

do the dance of love.

Ohh seeee...

</code></pre>

但这个熟语还有一个巴掌拍不响的意思。

比如：

bq.   “It takes two to tango” means that two people in a fight are both responsible for that fight. Example: “He hit me first; it wasn’t my fault!” Answer: “It takes two to tango.” Just like a dance between two lovers (the tango); one person might start the fight, but they both keep it going; it takes two [people] to [dance the] tango. Example: “Her husband is awful; they fight all the time.” Answer: “It takes two to tango.” A conflict is not the fault of just one person or the other; they are often both to blame, because it takes two to tango.
