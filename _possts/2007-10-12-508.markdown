oose

<blockquote>

By now, you’ve probably heard the background of the case: Last September, a black student at Jena High School asked permission during an assembly if he could sit beneath the “white tree,” a tree on campus where white students traditionally gathered. The student was told that he could sit wherever he liked. The next day, three nooses hung from the so-called “white tree.” The high school’s principal recommended expulsion for the three white students responsible for hanging the nooses, but the school district’s superintendent reduced their punishment to a three-day suspension, dismissing it as an adolescent prank that didn’t threaten anyone. The black student body of Jena High School protested the white students’ light punishment by gathering under the same “white tree.” LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters appeared at the school during the protest and said to students, “I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. I can take away your lives with a stroke of my pen.”

数上挂个noose是什么。我猜测是那个，但不敢肯定。

define: noose

<blockquote>

snare: a trap for birds or small mammals; often has a slip noose

make a noose in or of

a loop formed in a cord or rope by means of a slipknot; it binds tighter as the cord or rope is pulled

secure with a noose

The noose is a simple knot, normally made from a small-diameter rope, that is often used by campers and hunters to catch small game. The noose has also traditionally been known as a suicide method; however the actual knot associated with this is the Hangman’s knot.

看了这些解释我反而觉得像是抓小东的捕猎夹了。

从这张图看更应该是上吊和捕捉小动物的用的圈套/绳子？怎么说更准确啊。

此事发生在<strong><em>2007</em></strong>年的美国！！
