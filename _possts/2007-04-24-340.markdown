指那种言听必从的人

bq. Sheeple is a term of disparagement, created by combining the words “sheep” and “people.” It implies that those people it references believe whatever they are told, without processing it to be sure that it is an accurate representation of the real world around them. The term can be applied to any group, often in a political or comedic sense.It also rhymes with “steeple,” and can be used as an attack against Christians, who often refer to themselves as “flocks.”
