这篇文章说了一些<a href="http://wiki.rijiben.org/Z/%e5%90%ab%e6%9c%89%e5%9b%bd%e5%90%8d%e7%9a%84%e8%8b%b1%e6%96%87%e6%88%90%e8%af%ad">含有国名的成语</a>

不用故意去记忆。大部分说出来也没人明白。：）

从这些成语中可以很清楚地看见英语国家的人，英国人我猜想，对各国的态度是什么样子的。

让我想到了一个standup comedian说的段子，他说

他说在美国有一种能置人于死命的蜜蜂被叫做“african killer bee”。他说

<blockquote>

I think the emphasis here is killing here, not african. What if we name a bee who kills people in middle east “jew jew bee”? Hun? “Ah, jew jew bee, jew jew bee! Run~!”

</blockquote>

At this time a audience in the room said it wasn’t funny, she found it offensive.

<blockquote>

See, when it’s about you, you don’t think it’s funny!

让我们来看看几个含有中国国名的

4 Chinaman’s chance 机会有限

5 Chinese walls 严格保密，万无一失

都还不错。哈哈。

不过注意，chinanan是一种有些歧视性的叫发。不要用啊。

啊，开始我以为好似机会无限，还心里奇怪的，怎么中国人的机会是机会无限啊。看了一下是有限，这还差不多。

let’s dig up the history of the term

from <a href="http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinaman">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinaman</a>'s_chance">wikipedia</a>

<blockquote>

Someone with a Chinaman’s chance has no chance at all.



The “devolved” slang phrase: “Chinaman’s Chance”; meaning “a slim chance to make it”.



The original proper phrase is: “Chinaman’s Chance in Hell.”



The historical context of the phrase comes from the old railroad and Goldrush days of pre-California, where many Chinese came to work as laborers for the First Transcontinental Railroad, especially the Central Pacific Railroad. In this employ, they were sought out for the demanding and dangerous jobs involving explosives, often for half the pay of the Irish workers. Yet the Chinese had to pay additional and higher taxes, could not testify in court against violence against them, were denied citizenship, and could be forced from profitable property. The use and “devolution” of the slang phrase “Chinaman’s Chance in Hell,” into “Chinaman’s Chance,” resulted, ending up as an insult to Chinese people not necessarily as its original intention, but as a reflection of the callous attitude towards the lives of Chinese immigrant workers.

看来这个此开始不是贬义，而是客观地反应了第一批被强迫卖到美国加州修铁路的中国人生活的真是写照。他们工作劳累，危险，报酬确只有同工的爱尔兰人的一般。他们要付更高的睡，组三个不受到暴力侵害也无法在法庭上诉，不能加入美国国籍，如果住的地方恰巧有开发的利益，还会被强迫赶走。

<blockquote>

The term was used by United States Senate candidate John Spencer in the New York Republican primary race to describe the likelihood of his opponent defeating Hillary Clinton in a general election. This caused a rather major controversy as the term was deemed racist. Spencer apologized, insisting that he was only using a figure of speech.

</blockquote>

前些年John SpencerHillary Clinton普选成功的希望是chinaman’s chance时，引起了不小争议。他后来道歉了，说只是比喻的用法。
