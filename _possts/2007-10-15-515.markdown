Landrover seems to be having a massive come back on the world scene thanks to massive sales in various ‘newly rich’ states such as China, and Russia.

There are quite a few wealthy Chinese who have the spare funds available to blow on a social status SUV.

I’ve been to moscow, you can avoid running into a landrover, running into might be a bad choice of word, but most of the ‘rover drivers are driving “not safely to the others”. I do get a pseudo feeling (?) of safe when in a hunky SUV. I feel safer when I run into/crash other cars.

Before shouting on me, let me get this out first, i don’t have a car, yet!
