Love the idea! Great work!

Hollywood, in particular, Disney is against fair use in any possible way. By using Disney characters (I assume it’s unauthorized use, cos Disney won’t allow that happen) to explain fair use, in which the movie itself is an example of fair use (I assume it is fair use). I 

like the idea.

<object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>

Fair use is never a clear cut. I am fine with that. I am fine with going to a judge and let him decide whether it’s fair use or not. I am against any kind of anti-circumvention law which practically abolish fair use.
