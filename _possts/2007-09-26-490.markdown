PayPal sucks! It has all the allusions of being a bank, but without needing to fulfill any of the regulations necessary. It doesn’t have to answer to its customers in the way that a real bank does, and it doesn’t provide a balanced service. They are judge, juror, and executioner of any dispute. I don’t want to give my credit details to such an establishment. Alas, I can’t attend the next meeting of my local magicians group if I don’t. So I must duly submit my attendance fee by creating a temporary account, since it doesn’t support one-off transactions. Stupid! I then closed the account, and when submitted the “why have you closed your account” form by ticking the box “other”. Alas, it then required me to fill in a description for “other”. With a final sense of irony I wrote, “because I am required to fill in a description for ’other’”.

我也不相信paypal等。作者写的原因我同意。特别我不想让我信用卡信息和paypal帐号关联。当然，我暂时也没有信用卡。；）

我也不相信银行！

我根本就不太相信货币了现在！！为什么不信任现行的货币是一个很理论性的问题。同时也有很多现实的证据。注意：我说的是不信任货币，不是人民币，是所有现在使用的货币。（你说我怎么心里压力那么大啊，说点什么都得解释一下，就怕别人扣我破坏金融秩序的帽子。）

不是开玩笑。真的不是。

… yes, I do use my CC online - I’m not that paranoid! But, after having payment approved by Visa, two other sites popped up (Nochex, and SecureSuite, in case you’re interested) asking for my credit card information again. And date of birth. Although I’ve been assured these are not phishing sites, how am I to know? Since my schooling in security says that I shouldn’t give my details to any domain that doesn’t explicitly belong to my bank, I can’t shop. So, I’m being edged out of the virtual shopping malls, too.

What?! 还好，我网上唯一买过一次东西是lyon在amazon上买的时候我让他帮我也买了些。刷他的卡。我网上购买网络服务等也是刷他的卡。自己承担较小风险。lyon在amazon两次购物后卡就被恶意刷了70美元。还好他有短信即时通知。当时打电话给银行。似乎1个月后把那笔支付追回来了。
