<blockquote>

This choke point serves the entire airport, with exactly the result you would expect. Everyone waits. I once waited for an hour and then got a taxi driver who complained bitterly that he had waited for two hours and I was too small a fare to justify his wait.

justify

<ul>

<li>show to be reasonable or provide adequate ground for; “The emergency does not warrant all of us buying guns”; “The end justifies the means”</li>

<li>show to be right by providing justification or proof; “vindicate a claim”</li>

<li>apologize: defend, explain, clear away, or make excuses for by reasoning; “rationalize the child’s seemingly crazy behavior”; “he rationalized his lack of success”</li>

<li>absolve: let off the hook; “I absolve you from this responsibility”</li>

<li>adjust the spaces between words; “justify the margins”

</ul>

翻译justify？不足以弥补他等待的时间？不好，因为没有弥补，make up的意思。直接用“不值得”很好。但组织不起来整个句子。

That’s why the pirate taxis at Hongqiao always use the same pitch: “Hey, mister! Taxi-no-waiting!” Spectacular, as long as you don’t mind paying quadruple over a metered trip and re-bargaining at the halfway point. The bottleneck for legit taxis is so well designed to keep the pirate taxis in business that you’d think the airport administration was taking a tax-free cut off the top.
