contact cat lover organizations and ask for help.

in my case, we pull some money together, catch those cats we can and send them to vet to be made made infertile. Those we can catch, we ask for help and we have a voluntary vet to come to catch the cats and do the operation. He is paid, but he is not making money from this.

ask those who feed the cats the help, since they are spending money on feeding the cats. Usually they will agree to neuter the cats. Hardcore pro-(cat)-life pro-(cat)-reproduction-right people won’t help, it happens. I don’t see them against family planning, though.

I don’t know what price quote you get for the neuter operation. For us, 80 for male cat, 100 for female cat. If we have the volunteer vet to come to TNR, 60 for male cat, 80-100 for female cat. Price at vets may varied, about 150 for female cat top?

什么是TNR？

　　

TNR是英文trap（捕捉）、neuter（结扎）、release（放养）的缩写，是现今唯一经过证实能有效控制街猫数量的办法。

　　

TNR的任务是尽可能把一个群落的猫全部捕捉起来，施以结扎手术，放回原来生活的地方，结扎后的猫以剪耳作为标记。
