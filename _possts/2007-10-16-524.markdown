假书？不，攒的书都算不上

By John L (LONDON, UK) - See all my reviews

Ken Pizzini has not written a book about sed; rather, this is just the printed version of the manual/info page that comes with GNU sed, together with some padding about the free documentation licence and the GNU project.

Oh yes, and 53 (fifty-three) completely blank pages.

And look at the photo of the front cover. Spot the missing word: “Sed — A Stream …”

Don’t buy this. 

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sed-Stream-Editor-Ken-Pizzini/dp/0595100430/ref=pd_bbs_6/102-4073332-7886520?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190334185&sr=8-6">http://www.amazon.com/Sed-Stream-Editor-Ken-Piz...</a>

其实把文档直接印成书是GFDL允许的也是鼓励的。我有时也希望有一本能随时翻看查阅的。但不能搞这种质量差还以“骗钱”而不是赚钱为目的的。
