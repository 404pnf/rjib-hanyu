bad hair day

<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bad+hair+day">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=...</a>

<blockquote>

A bad hair day is also a day when everything is going bad. It has nothing to do with how one’s hair really is, it’s just that everything is going wrong. The term “bad hair day” derives from how psycho one feels because everything is going all wrong on a particular day!!

第一次听到这个词似乎是在Office Space这部经典电影中。：）可能吧。
