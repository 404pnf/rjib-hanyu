The Juilliard School 是很有名的艺术类学校

Now I know how to spell this well-known school, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juilliard_School">The Juilliard School</a>. I thought it’s Julia.

In the movie, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu%27s_Most_Wanted">Malibu’s Most Wanted</a>, the two black actors (they play actors in the film) were hired to “play ghetto”, to play gansters, and when questioned about “if you think you can’t handle the job”, one replied:”oh, we can handle it. God, I graduated from Juillard”. It’s such a great take that blacks graduated from prestigious art school and still hired to play gangsters or something to that effect as one actor puts it. I love that movie!
