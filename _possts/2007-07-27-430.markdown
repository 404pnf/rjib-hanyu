老听这个词不太明白什么意思。

a la carte

<blockquote>

a menu having individual dishes listed with separate prices

(of a restaurant meal) having unlimited choices with a separate price for each item

by ordering items listed individually on a menu; “we ate a la carte”

A la carte (also à la carte), is a French phrase meaning “from the menu”, and it is used in restaurant terminology in one of two ways: First, it may refer to a menu of items priced and ordered separately rather than selected from a list of preset multi-course meals at set prices.

看来我以前猜错了，我以为和all you can eat是相似的呢。看来是单点的意思：）

这个词怎么翻译好？翻译成“单点”怎么样。因为正好是从点菜中来的。
