A confidence trick, confidence game, or con for short (also known as a scam) is an attempt to intentionally mislead a person or persons (known as the mark) usually with the goal of financial or other gain. The confidence trickster, con man, scam artist or con artist often works with an accomplice called the shill, who tries to encourage the mark by pretending to believe the trickster. …

More recently, he has accused the Shanxi female worker Guo Xiaojuan of embezzling 150,000 in donations after completing her tumor-removal surgery.  He spent his own money to travel from Shenzhen to Shanxi to conduct his investigation.  But his action was regarded as immoral and an example of Internet violence.

I don’t understand the logic why “his action was regarded as immoral and an example of Internet violence”. Yes, you read that right. I didn’t know about the story and don’t intend to research on that. But what’s internet violence, do they mean <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&q=define%3Aslander&btnG=Search">slander</a>? This couldn’t be a translation erro, as the translator eastsouthwestnorth is reliable. I don’t know what is 网络暴力。

搜了一下，看了几篇“新闻报道”大概知道是什么意思了。这个词现在还真是老有人用。大致意思是

<blockquote>

近期发生的多起网络事件中，很多网民依仗匿名身份，肆无忌惮地对事主的隐私权进行侵犯。他们不必为自己的行为承担任何责任，享受着风险趋近于零的所谓“自由”，高举的是道德之旗，行的却是“暴力”之实。

英文的internet violence没有中文里这个意思。基本上也没有人用这个说法。用了别人猜测不出中文意思的。我开始看文章以为是指网上的一些暴力内容呢。
