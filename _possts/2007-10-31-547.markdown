You can always buy a GOL if you get confused. F knows where the F went!!

The Gol was for the three developing markets, India, Brazil, and China.



I guess to cut down on costs they knocked the back doors off and made the car shorter. The F must have been knocked off to save on cost.

I love the affordable gol~ but it’s not allowed to be sold in beijing because the its emission doesn’t qualified. Not clean enough.
