Reflections on the brain of an idiot 文中说到人们称呼智力有问题的词一直在变化和变化的原因是什么很有意思

我这个题目用额不好。但我想不出如何称呼那些开始被称为idiot（开始的时候是医学术语没有贬义），后来因为idiot有贬义医学术语就改为其他词，后来那个其他词也有贬义医学界有用了个新词，如此几次。这也是我对这篇文章感兴趣的地方。

<blockquote>

Back in 1871, the term ‘idiot’ was a proper medical term. It referred to someone we would now describe as having learning disabilities or intellectual impairment.



As the word became used as an everyday form of abuse, it left the realms of medicine because it was deemed inappropriate, and has been replaced by seemingly more appropriate terms. There is a long history of this process and it continues to this day.

The author goes on to give two more examples. Interesting read.
