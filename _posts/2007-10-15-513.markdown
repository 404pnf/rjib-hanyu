Did he pay a quick visit to China this time? This time, sparotically covered in some business related news channel, as seen here <a href="http://news.stockstar.com/info/darticle.aspx?id=JL,20071015,00186874&columnid=2921">http://news.stockstar.com/info/darticle.aspx?id...</a>

The governator recently showed up in China, unbeknown to China Car Times, the wall of muscle that is Arnold Schwarzenegger paid a visit to Youngman auto as they recently signed up with ZAP! autos to make electric vehicles for the US market, you can read more about that deal here.

Last time he visited in Beijing as a governor but more as a super movie start to appear in one of his movie’s premier or someone else’ movie, he only came here to promote hollywood, which is true?
