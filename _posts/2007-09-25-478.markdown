<blockquote>

At 11:00, I called 110.



You can file a complaint about any SMS related to illegal activities, such as providing fake documents, selling stolen vehicles, pornography, drug dealing, etc.  We are unable to handle apartment sales, discount airline tickets and other SMS advertisements,” said the police comrade.



I reported two mobile telephone numbers that were offering fake documentation.



“We will forward the information to the relevant department.  If verified, we will shut down those telephone numbers.  Presently, there is no real-name registration system for mobile telephones, so it is hard to track down the individuals.  Some of these people will just change the number and continue to send.  You should check with other departments about the junk SMS advertisements,” said the police officer.



So who is in charge of the junk SMS?

这篇文章是说到底谁在发这些讨厌的广告短信。

可以看出，如果短信内容是设计办证、走私等，可以举报给110。如果只是广告，警察不管。中国电信方面，可以投诉广告。他们查看一下，如果发的人确实违规，那么就停那个号。但联通号发的他们不管。

还有一个问题没有提到，就是几年前我听说有些广告短消息是非法通过自制电路版等发的。也许我描述的不对。有这种情况么。

这类垃圾短信最最讨厌了。他们和垃圾邮件还不一样。垃圾邮件可以机器过滤，而且处理起来快得多。但短信不同了。你要拿出手机，按几个键去看短信，然后按几个键去删除。真tmd讨厌！
