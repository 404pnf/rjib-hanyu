Hatchback is a term describing an automobile design, consisting of a passenger cabin with an integrated cargo space, accessed from behind the vehicle by a tailgate or flip-up window. The vehicle must have at least two rows of seats, with the rear set able to fold down to increase cargo space.

Hatchback vehicles are functionally similar to station wagons (which are intended to carry large volumes), but distinguished by a smaller load area. Some vehicles achieve this by having little car length behind the C-Pillar and thus no room for a side window over the load area. Others achieve this by a steeply raked rear window - a style also known as a liftback. All liftbacks are hatchbacks with a fastback profile

就是国内常说两厢车，当然还有一种notchback，咱们也叫两厢吧？这里是<a href="http://www.rijiben.org/yingyu/1248/">notchback的解释</a>。

还是有不一样。你们说哪里不一样？
