Tall and tan and young and lovely

The girl from Ipanema goes walking

And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she’s like a samba

That swings so cool and sways so gentle

That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ooh

(Ooh) But I watch her so sadly

How can I tell her [...]
