In law, a writ is a formal written order issued by a government entity in the name of the sovereign power. In most cases, this public entity is a court. Warrants, prerogative writs, and subpoenas are types of writs, but there are many others.

I guess it means, where there is a success (hit), there is going to be someone claim their rights over it.

Similiar to “If value, then right” ?
