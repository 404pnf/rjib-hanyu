Oh,

Why you look so sad?

Tears are in your eyes

Come on and come to me now

Don’t be ashamed to cry

Let me see you through

‘Cause I’ve seen the dark side too

When the night falls on you

You don’t know what to do

Nothing you confess

Could make me you love you less

I’ll stand by you

I’ll stand by you

Won’t let nobody [...]
