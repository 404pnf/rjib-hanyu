I will rewatch the Spin City on DVD.

<blockquote>

Spin City has not yet been released on DVD - or at least not entirely, but will be in the near future. Dreamworks has, however, published two smaller DVD boxes titled “Michael J. Fox - His All Time Favorites” Vols. 1 and 2 in 2003, both containing eleven episodes.

Some episodes are pretty funny!
