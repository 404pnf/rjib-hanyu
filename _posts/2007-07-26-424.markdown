<a href="http://www.negativland.com/albini.html">The Problem With Music - by Steve Albini</a>

I will translate this article. Anybody help?

He is a musician and producer, you might know him as the producer for Nirvana’s album In Utero. But, he is more than that.

I love his way of doing recording engineers and never take the royalty assicated with CD sells since he beleives it’s immoral.

Read him on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini">wikipedia</a>
