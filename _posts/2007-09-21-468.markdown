猜猜 Two ants wrestling with crumbs 是什么体育项目 ；）

<blockquote>

On Wednesday, my wife and I watched a U.S. Open tennis match in Arthur Ashe Stadium. You have never seen anything like it, unless you have been lucky enough to see an ant wrestle with a crumb. That’s what it looked like from our cheap seats. Obviously I am exaggerating, because the tennis match involved two players, not one. Two ants wrestling with crumbs is obviously twice as good as one.

Read the full post. It’s funny!

Two ants wrestling with crumbs 翻译成“两只蚂蚁和面包渣战斗”？你们会怎么翻译这个幽默的说法。

本文说明体育比赛看现场，基本上是为了感受气氛。从观看效果来讲，还是电视好。除非你有钱买很好的票。那种票也很少啊。

现在中国网球公开赛。我记得去年有10元左右，很便宜的票？不知道很便宜的位子是不是很高，让有恐高症的人都不敢坐啊。：）

Did you know that tennis backwards is sin net? Cue scary music…
