Who has the film - The Sting -? Please tell me if the soundtrack of the movie is regtime music. I just listened to this composer who did the soundtrack, he also did the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_We_Were:The_title_song">the way we were</a>“, hmm, the “Memory~, di duh duh di duh di duh….”

Oh, there you go, the composer is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Hamlisch">Marvin Hamlisch</a>, his lecture on penn state university is great. You can download it from WPSU podcast, just search it, and post the link in the comment, thanks. <img src='http://www.rijiben.org/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ….. update: could this be the link to that mp3 file? <a href="http://streams.wpsx.psu.edu/Marvin_Hamlisch06012.html">http://streams.wpsx.psu.edu/Marvin_Hamlisch0601...</a> How do you download the mp3. I downloaded through podcast feed so I never go to their website. Somebody please figure it out and post it in the comment.

Wikipedia’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sting">entry on the film</a> is much more detailed.

I want the soundtrack of the film. Anybody, help?
