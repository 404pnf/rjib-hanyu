precedence; pertinent

<blockquote>

Yesterday I was translating an article by a People’s University professor that called for Chinese to take precedence over English during the Olympics.  More than half-way through the translation, I realised that the article is too long for a blog post and no one will read it.  Instead, I will summarise the article briefly because I think it mentions some pertinent points.  The article appeared on page 31 in the Nanfang Zhoumo on August 16.

To summerize the article on the newspaper, the auther believes “Instead of concentrating on English, he believes that the Olympics present a great opportunity to popularise Chinese. “
