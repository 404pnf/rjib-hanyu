It’s sorta stupid but you just couldn’t get it out of your mind in 1993. Whenever i think of this song i think i see Jiang3nan2 acting ghetto and sing “whoomp there it is”, it’s so funny!

For a brief time i thought tag team was a professional wrestling group. Today, by reading the wikipedia article, it confirms it’s not the case.
