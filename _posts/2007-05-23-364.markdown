<blockquote>

At first you don’t really understand what the bok is about. Things are not put down as you’d expect from reading any of the authors previous works. Completely umlike “1234″ and the award acclaimmed “Abcd”, “Asdfas” takes a very surprising route. The narrative is very caotic, intricate, and really makes the reader play a game with the pages. It reminded me a little bit of Julio Cortázar’s work in “Hopscotch”. Great effort by indian postwar master Asdf.
