这里的 post-mortem 是下棋复盘还是验尸？！

<blockquote>

It has been a little over two weeks since our facility move. I believe at some point we promised some post-mortem analysis of what went right and what went wrong, and here it is.

define: post-mortem

<blockquote>

Analysis of a game after it has concluded, typically conducted by one or both players and sometimes spectators (kibitzers) as well.

analysis following a game

这两个解释我理解就是下棋复盘的意思。

<blockquote>

postmortem: discussion of an event after it has occurred

autopsy: an examination and dissection of a dead body to determine cause of death or the changes produced by disease

这里第一个解释不好理解为复盘，第2个autopsy是尸体解剖吧。dissection是把什么东西分开，具体这里把什么分开了，你自己看。

<blockquote>

An autopsy, also known as a post-mortem examination, necropsy, or obduction, is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a person’s death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. …

</blockquote>

这个解释让我认为这个词是验尸的意思。因为解剖目的是查明死因。

不知道我的理解对不对。

那么我给的那段引文如何翻译呢。翻译成复盘么？有没有更好的答案。参与一下吧。
