Drag queens are performers - usually gay men, sometimes transgendered women - who dress in “drag,” clothing associated with the female gender, usually highly exaggerated versions thereof. Drag queens often do drag to perform, singing or lip-syncing and dancing, participating in events such as gay pride parades, cabarets, discotheques, and other celebrations and venues.

每当听到这个词，我就想到margrette cho在她一个段子里说的drag queens are the backbone of the gay community这句。之后解释了为什么：） 自己去听吧。在emule中搜索她的standup comedy。
